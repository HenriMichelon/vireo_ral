\page manual_060_00_queues Submission queues

Submission queues are used to submit work to the GPU.
You submit recorded \ref manual_050_00_commands "command lists" with a \ref vireo::SubmitQueue "SubmitQueue".
Work is executed asynchronously on the GPU and \ref manual_090_00_synchronization "synchronization" between queues
(or with CPU) must be handled explicitly by the developer.

...More to come...
