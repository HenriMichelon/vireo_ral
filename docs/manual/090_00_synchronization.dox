\page manual_090_00_synchronization Synchronization

The synchronization objects ensure writes complete before reads (read-after-write), avoid write-after-write races, etc.
They are use to know when work is done or when resources are free.

Vireo have three synchronization objects :
- \subpage manual_090_01_fences "Fences"
- \subpage manual_090_02_semaphores "Semaphores"
- \subpage manual_090_03_barriers "Memory barriers"

...More to come...
