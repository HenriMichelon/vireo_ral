A pipeline is an object storing the GPU state needed to execute shaders

They come in two flavors:
- \subpage manual_080_01_graphic_pipelines "Graphics Pipeline" : for draw calls (vertex → raster → fragment).
- \subpage manual_080_02_compute_pipelines "Compute Pipeline" : for dispatch calls (single compute shader).


...More to come...
